📘 React Loan Application Question:
Scenario:
You're building a simple Loan Management Application in React. The application should:
1. Allow the user to input a loan amount (e.g., ₹1,00,000).
2. Track the amount utilized by the user (e.g., ₹20,000).
3. Based on the amount utilized, calculate and show the interest payable (e.g., interest
only on ₹20,000).
4. Allow the user to input the interest rate (e.g., 10% per annum).
5. Display the calculated interest dynamically.
🎯 Your Task:
Create a React component called LoanInterestCalculator with the following features:
● Input fields:
○ Loan Amount (initial total loan)
○ Amount Used (the portion of the loan the user has used)
○ Interest Rate (in percentage)
● Output:
○ Calculate and display the interest to be paid on the amount used, not the full
🧮 Interest Formula:

Interest = (Amount Used × Interest Rate) / 100

✅ Bonus (Optional):

Add validation: Used amount should not exceed loan amount.

● Format currency nicely (e.g., ₹20,000 instead of just 20000).
